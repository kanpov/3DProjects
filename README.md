# 3D Projects

A repository of my 3D projects made in [Blender](https://blender.org), managed and backed up using Git & GitHub.

Browse the directories in this repository to find the projects.

Each project contains:

- A `README.md` with a short summary of the project (_WIP_)
- The primary `.blend` file
- The rendered `.png` image
- Sometimes, the reference `.png` image
- When needed, extra resources (like external textures) accompanying the `.blend` file
